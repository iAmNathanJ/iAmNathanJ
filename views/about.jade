      | <strong>I am self-taught.</strong><br>
      | I actually started learning web development about ten years ago. 
      | Playing in a couple different bands at the time, I had to learn how to give us a home online. I think this is a common scenario for a lot of self-taught devs. I realized that I enjoyed the process of bringing a website to life as much as I enjoyed the music I was playing. I spent a few years creating and maintaining various iterations of sites for those bands. When the music ended, unfortunately so did the web development. Life required I maintain employment in another field along the way, and I continued down another professional path for a few more years. About six months ago I realized what I really wanted to do was get back to creating websites. So I quit my job and have immersed myself in learning all that I missed out on in the time I was away from coding. No doubt I have expanded my knowledge base, but I still have a way to go before I am satisfied with my abilities.

      | I prefer not to limit myself to these technologies. 
      | I love learning whatever is necessary to solve a given problem.
      | I am largely self-driven and very committed to becoming a great developer. I love to collaborate, I'm slightly obsessed with details, and I'm looking to push my skillset and grow.<br><br>
