      | I am self-taught.<br>
      | I actually started learning web development about ten years ago. 
      | I played in a couple different bands at the time, both of which were in need of online credibility... and so began my journey. 
      
      <br><br>

      | My current toolbox includes...
        ul
          li HTML5
          li CSS3 / Sass / Stylus
          li JavaScript / jQuery / Angular
          li Node / Express
          li Gulp &amp; Grunt
          li php / Wordpress
          li Photoshop / Illustrator

      | I prefer not to limit myself to these technologies. 
      | I love learning whatever is necessary to solve a given problem.
      | I am largely self-driven and very committed to becoming a great developer. I love to collaborate, I'm slightly obsessed with details, and I'm looking to push my skillset and grow.<br><br>
      | Feel free to contact me below. I'd love to hear from you.
